## Introduction

Traditional cybersecurity often operates with distinct Red Teams (offensive, simulating attackers) and Blue Teams (defensive, protecting and responding). While valuable, these teams can sometimes work in silos, leading to lengthy feedback loops and missed opportunities for immediate improvement. Enter **Purple Teaming**: a collaborative approach where Red and Blue teams work *together* in real-time during simulated attacks to test, measure, and enhance detection and response capabilities.

A Purple Team exercise isn't about Red "winning" or Blue "winning"; it's about the organization collectively improving its security posture through open communication, shared understanding, and immediate feedback. This article outlines the planning and execution phases of effective Purple Team exercises.

## Why Purple Team? The Benefits of Collaboration

*   **Accelerated Improvement:** Real-time feedback allows Blue Teams to tune detections (SIEM rules, EDR logic, firewall policies) *during* the exercise, with Red Teams immediately re-testing to validate the fix.
*   **Enhanced Understanding:** Blue Teams gain deeper insight into attacker TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and how they manifest in logs and telemetry. Red Teams understand Blue Team visibility limitations and detection logic intricacies.
*   **Validation of Controls:** Moves beyond theoretical assumptions to test if security controls and detection mechanisms *actually* work as expected against specific threats.
*   **Increased Efficiency:** Reduces the time gap between attack simulation, detection analysis, and control improvement compared to traditional, separate engagements.
*   **Improved Communication & Relationships:** Fosters stronger working relationships and shared goals between offensive and defensive security professionals.
*   **Targeted Skill Development:** Provides hands-on learning opportunities for both teams based on realistic scenarios.

## Planning the Purple Team Exercise: Setting the Stage for Success

Thorough planning is critical for a productive Purple Team exercise. Rushing this phase often leads to confusion and wasted effort.

### 1. Define Clear Objectives & Scope
*   **What are we testing?** Be specific. Are you validating detections for specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques (e.g., Kerberoasting, Scheduled Tasks)? Testing the response to a particular threat actor's known TTPs? Validating a new EDR deployment?
*   **What's in scope?** Define the target systems, networks, user accounts, and data that are part of the exercise.
*   **What's out of scope?** Clearly state any systems, actions, or data that must *not* be touched to avoid disrupting critical operations.

### 2. Select Relevant TTPs
*   Based on the objectives, choose a manageable list of specific TTPs to simulate. Prioritize techniques relevant to your threat landscape, industry, or known security gaps.
*   Reference frameworks like MITRE ATT&CKÂ® for standardized TTP identification (e.g., T1059.001 - PowerShell, T1548.002 - Bypass User Account Control).

### 3. Establish Rules of Engagement (RoE)
*   **Communication:** How will teams communicate during the exercise (e.g., dedicated chat channel, conference call)? Who is the primary point of contact?
*   **Execution Cadence:** Will the Red Team announce each step *before* execution, or execute and then confirm? How long should the Blue Team have to detect before moving on?
*   **Definition of "Detection":** Does an alert need to fire? Is manual log correlation sufficient? Define success criteria clearly.
*   **Halting Conditions:** Under what circumstances should the exercise pause or stop (e.g., critical system impact, unexpected Blue Team response)?
*   **Tooling:** What tools are permitted for both Red and Blue teams?

### 4. Identify Participants & Roles
*   **Red Team:** Members responsible for executing the agreed-upon TTPs.
*   **Blue Team:** Members responsible for monitoring security tools (SIEM, EDR, NTA, etc.), analyzing alerts, and potentially tuning detections.
*   **Coordinator/Facilitator (Optional but Recommended):** An individual (often from either team or a neutral party) to manage logistics, keep the exercise on track, facilitate communication, and help document findings.

### 5. Prepare Logistics & Environment
*   **Schedule:** Block dedicated time for all participants. Purple Teaming requires focused effort.
*   **Access:** Ensure Red Team has necessary (but controlled) access, and Blue Team has visibility into relevant logs and tools.
*   **Documentation Platform:** Set up a shared space (wiki, spreadsheet, document) for real-time logging of actions, observations, detection status, and notes.
*   **Baseline:** Ensure monitoring and logging systems are functioning correctly *before* the exercise begins.

## Executing the Purple Team Exercise: The Collaborative Loop

This is where the planning comes to life. The core is the iterative loop of execution, detection, feedback, and refinement.

### 1. Kick-off Briefing
*   Gather all participants.
*   Review objectives, scope, RoE, communication plan, and the list of TTPs.
*   Ensure everyone understands their role and the exercise flow.

### 2. Iterative TTP Execution & Monitoring
*   **Red Team Action:** The Red Team executes a specific, agreed-upon TTP (potentially announcing it just before or after, per RoE). They document the exact command, time, source/destination IPs, user context, etc.
*   **Blue Team Monitoring:** The Blue Team actively monitors their tools for relevant alerts or telemetry corresponding to the Red Team's action. They document what they see (or don't see), the tools involved, timestamps, and alert fidelity.

### 3. Real-time Communication & Feedback (The Purple Core)
*   **Immediate Check-in:** Did the Blue Team detect the action?
    *   **If Yes:** Where was it detected (SIEM rule X, EDR alert Y)? How quickly? Was the alert clear and actionable? Was it the *expected* detection mechanism? Discuss the quality of the detection.
    *   **If No (or Partially):** Why not? Was the necessary log source missing? Was the detection logic flawed? Is there a visibility gap? The Red Team might provide additional IOCs or context to aid Blue Team analysis.

### 4. Analysis & Tuning (If Needed)
*   If a detection failed or needs improvement, the Blue Team analyzes the gap *during the exercise*.
*   They may attempt to tune SIEM rules, adjust EDR policies, or identify missing log sources.

### 5. Re-testing & Validation
*   If tuning occurred, the Red Team re-runs the *same* TTP to validate whether the new/updated detection logic is effective. This immediate validation is a key benefit.

### 6. Documentation
*   Throughout the exercise, meticulous documentation by all parties is crucial in the shared platform. Log:
    *   TTP Executed (with details)
    *   Timestamp
    *   Expected Detection
    *   Actual Outcome (Detected / Missed / Partially Detected / Prevented)
    *   Detection Source (SIEM Rule ID, EDR Policy Name, etc.)
    *   Analyst Observations
    *   Tuning Actions Taken
    *   Validation Results

### 7. Repeat
*   Continue this loop for each planned TTP.

## Post-Exercise Activities: Capturing Value

*   **Debrief/Wash-up:** Immediately following the exercise, hold a meeting to discuss overall successes, challenges, surprises, and key takeaways.
*   **Formal Reporting:** Compile the documented findings into a formal report detailing objectives, TTPs tested, detection outcomes, analysis, and specific, actionable recommendations.
*   **Action Item Tracking:** Assign owners and deadlines for implementing recommendations (e.g., deploying new log sources, finalizing rule tuning, updating incident response playbooks).
*   **Knowledge Sharing:** Share findings and lessons learned with broader security teams and potentially development/infrastructure teams.

## Conclusion

Purple Teaming transforms adversarial simulation from a discrete test into a continuous improvement cycle. By fostering direct collaboration and real-time feedback between offensive and defensive teams, organizations can significantly enhance their ability to detect and respond to real-world threats, moving beyond assumptions to build a demonstrably more resilient security posture. It requires planning, commitment, and a collaborative mindset, but the payoff in improved defenses is substantial.
