# Certifications & Career in Blue Team

How certs fit the [roadmaps](#/learning/blue/beginner-blue-team-roadmap), what roles to expect, and how to get the first job. Kept concise so it stays maintainable; adjust for your region and market.

## Certifications: How They Fit the Roadmaps

### Beginner Stage (0–12 months)

- **BTL1** (Security Blue Team) — Blue Team Level 1. Entry-level defensive cert; hands-on and practical. Good after you have log and triage basics from the [Beginner roadmap](#/learning/blue/beginner-blue-team-roadmap). Reinforces SOC and detection thinking.
- **Vendor fundamentals** — Splunk, Microsoft (e.g. SC-200), or Elastic fundamentals if your target role uses that platform. Pair with lab work; cert alone is not enough.
- **Avoid for now** — GCIH, GCFE, and similar until you have solid triage and IR basics. Those certs assume you can already work with logs and runbooks; build the foundation first.

### Intermediate Stage (6–18 months)

- **GCIH** (GIAC Certified Incident Handler) — Incident response focused. Good when you are moving from SOC to IR or want to formalize IR skills. See [Intermediate roadmap](#/learning/blue/intermediate-blue-team-roadmap).
- **GCFE** (GIAC Certified Forensic Examiner) — Digital forensics. Useful for IR and investigation depth; not required for every blue team role.
- **GCIA** (GIAC Certified Intrusion Analyst) — Network and log analysis. Strong for NSM and detection engineering.
- **Splunk / Elastic / Sentinel** — Deeper vendor certs when your role centers on that SIEM. Prefer certs that include hands-on or labs.
- **Other practical certs** — BTL2 (if available), vendor-specific (e.g. cloud security, EDR). Prefer certs that require hands-on or scenario-based work.

### Advanced Stage (12+ months)

- **Leadership and program** — No single “advanced blue team” cert; experience leading IR, owning detection program, or designing purple team matters more. See [Advanced roadmap](#/learning/blue/advanced-blue-team-roadmap).
- **Multiple certs** — Depth matters more than count. One GCIH or BTL1 done well is better than three certs done poorly. Use certs to prove you can perform; use playbooks and detection work to prove you can deliver.

## Typical Roles

- **SOC analyst (L1/L2)** — Front-line monitoring and triage; run playbooks and escalate. Often the first role after certs and labs. Expect 1–3 years before moving to L2, IR, or detection.
- **Detection engineer** — Build and tune detection rules (Sigma, SIEM, EDR); map coverage to ATT&CK; work with SOC and purple team. Often comes from SOC or a technical background.
- **Incident responder** — Lead or support IR: contain, eradicate, recover; post-incident review and playbook updates. May be on-call. Often promoted from SOC L2 or from sysadmin/networking.
- **Threat hunter** — Hypothesis-driven hunting; feed findings into detection and tuning. May be dedicated or part of detection/IR team.
- **Lead / principal** — Own IR process, detection program, or purple team design. See [Advanced roadmap](#/learning/blue/advanced-blue-team-roadmap).

Titles vary by employer; focus on the work (SOC vs IR vs detection vs hunting) rather than the label.

## What to Expect

- **Workload** — Mix of technical work (triage, detection, IR) and non-technical (documentation, playbooks, communication, shift handoffs). The “watch dashboards all day” image is incomplete; writing and process are a large part of the job.
- **Salary and conditions** — Vary by region, employer, and experience. Junior SOC roles exist; salaries tend to rise with experience and certs. Research your market (job boards, salary surveys) rather than relying on generic figures.
- **Remote vs on-site** — Many SOC and detection roles allow remote or hybrid; some IR or 24/7 SOC roles require on-site or shift work. Check job postings and ask in interviews.

## Getting the First Job

- **Portfolio** — Labs, playbooks (sanitized), triage or hunt writeups, and (if possible) sample detection rules. Show that you can document and communicate, not just run tools. GitHub, a blog, or a simple portfolio site help.
- **One solid cert** — BTL1, GCIH, or vendor cert (e.g. Splunk) that matches the role. It signals that you have been tested. Pair it with the portfolio.
- **Networking** — Conferences (BSides, DEF CON, local meetups), LinkedIn (follow practitioners, engage thoughtfully), and contributing (Sigma rules, writeups) get your name in front of hiring managers.
- **Apply widely** — SOC and blue team roles are competitive. Apply to MSSPs, enterprises, and consultancies. Junior roles may be listed as “SOC analyst,” “security analyst,” or “L1”; read the description for triage, detection, or IR work.
- **Interview prep** — Be ready to explain how you triage an alert, what logs you’d look at for a scenario, and how you’d document it. Technical questions often focus on logs, ATT&CK, and SIEM/EDR; soft questions on shift work, escalation, and handling pressure. See [FAQ](#/learning/blue/blue-team-faq) and the roadmaps.

## Summary

- Use certs to prove you can perform; use the roadmaps to build the skills that certs test. Do not stack certs without depth.
- First role is often SOC L1 or security analyst; progress to L2, detection, IR, or hunting depending on interest. Documentation and process matter as much as technical skills.
- Build a portfolio, get one solid cert, network, and apply. The [FAQ](#/learning/blue/blue-team-faq) and roadmaps answer “how long” and “what to learn”; this page answers “what’s next” after learning.
