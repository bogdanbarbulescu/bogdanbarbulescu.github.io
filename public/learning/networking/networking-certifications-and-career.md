# Certifications & Career in Networking

How certs fit the [roadmaps](#/learning/networking/beginner-networking-roadmap), what roles to expect, and how to get the first job. Kept concise so it stays maintainable; adjust for your region and market.

## Entry and associate level

- **CCNA** (Cisco) — Broad associate-level cert: switching, routing, basics of security, automation, and more. Widely recognized; good after you complete the [Beginner roadmap](#/learning/networking/beginner-networking-roadmap). Reinforces fundamentals and is often the first credential employers look for.
- **JNCIA** (Juniper) — Juniper’s entry-level. Good if you’re in a Juniper shop or want a second vendor. Concepts overlap with CCNA.
- **CompTIA Network+** — Vendor-neutral; lighter than CCNA but useful for help desk or general IT moving into networking. Can precede or run in parallel with vendor certs.

## Professional and specialist

- **CCNP** (Cisco) — Multiple tracks (Enterprise, Security, etc.). Do after CCNA when you want deeper design and troubleshooting. Aligns with [Intermediate](#/learning/networking/intermediate-networking-roadmap) and [Advanced](#/learning/networking/advanced-networking-roadmap) topics.
- **JNCIP / JNCIE** (Juniper) — Progressive depth. Same idea: prove you can design and operate at scale.
- **Other vendors** — Arista, Palo Alto, etc. have their own certs. Choose based on job postings and your target role; see [Roles in Networking](#/learning/networking/networking-roles-and-expectations).

## Typical roles and progression

- **NOC technician / junior network engineer** — Monitor, troubleshoot, and perform routine changes. Often the first role after certs and labs. Expect 1–3 years before moving to mid-level. See [Where to Practice](#/learning/networking/where-to-practice-networking) to build lab experience that interviews expect.
- **Network engineer** — Design and implement changes; own parts of the network. May specialize (routing, security, wireless).
- **Senior / architect** — Own design and standards; lead projects and mentor. See [Advanced roadmap](#/learning/networking/advanced-networking-roadmap).

Titles vary by employer; focus on the work (operations vs design vs security) rather than the label.

## Getting the first job

- **Lab and document** — Every lab should produce a short summary (topology, what you did, what you’d improve). Portfolios and GitHub (configs, automation scripts) get your name in front of hiring managers. The [FAQ](#/learning/networking/networking-faq) and roadmaps answer “how long” and “what to learn”; this page answers “what’s next” after learning.
- **Apply widely** — NOC and junior network roles are competitive. Apply to enterprises, MSPs, and carriers. Read the description for hands-on networking and growth.
- **Interview prep** — Be ready to explain subnetting, how a packet gets from A to B, and a lab or change you did. Technical questions often focus on routing, switching, and basic security; soft questions on troubleshooting process and teamwork. See [Glossary](#/learning/networking/networking-glossary) and the roadmaps for concepts to reinforce.

## Summary

- First role is often NOC or junior network engineer; progress to engineer, then senior or architect if you want. Documentation and communication matter as much as technical skills.
- Build a lab habit, get one solid foundational cert (e.g. CCNA), document your work, and apply. The [FAQ](#/learning/networking/networking-faq) and roadmaps answer “how long” and “what to learn”; this page answers “what’s next” after learning.
