# Roles in Networking: NOC, Design, Security

A clear comparison so you know what each path involves and which fits you. For the learning path itself, see the [roadmaps](#/learning/networking/beginner-networking-roadmap).

---

## NOC (Network Operations Center)

- **What they do** — Monitor the network 24/7, respond to alerts, perform routine changes (e.g. port enable/disable, standard config updates), open and track tickets, and escalate to design or engineering when needed. You keep the network running and documented.
- **Day-to-day** — Dashboards, ticket queues, runbooks, change windows, and coordination with other teams. You learn how the network actually behaves under load and failure.
- **Who it fits** — People who like hands-on, shift-based or on-call work and want to build experience before moving to design or security. Often the first networking role; see [Certifications & Career](#/learning/networking/networking-certifications-and-career).

---

## Network Design / Engineering

- **What they do** — Design new segments, choose technologies (routing protocols, VLANs, redundancy), size links and devices, and produce diagrams and standards. They define *how* the network should look and behave.
- **Day-to-day** — Meetings with stakeholders, capacity planning, design docs, lab validation, and handoff to operations. Less “break-fix,” more “build it right.”
- **Who it fits** — People who like architecture, documentation, and long-term planning. Usually you move here after NOC or similar operational experience; see [Intermediate](#/learning/networking/intermediate-networking-roadmap) and [Advanced](#/learning/networking/advanced-networking-roadmap) roadmaps.

## Network Security

- **What they do** — Secure the network: firewalls, IDS/IPS, segmentation, VPNs, and security policies. They work with security and compliance teams and often partner with red/blue team on design and monitoring.
- **Day-to-day** — Firewall rule reviews, VPN design, segmentation audits, and responding to security incidents that involve the network. Overlaps with NOC when it comes to monitoring and with design when it comes to secure architecture.
- **Who it fits** — People who like both networking and security. Can start from NOC or from a security role and deepen networking; see [Further Reading](#/learning/networking/networking-reading-list) for security-focused resources.

## Quick comparison

| | NOC | Design | Security |
|--|-----|--------|----------|
| **Focus** | Run and maintain | Plan and build | Protect and segment |
| **Typical entry** | First networking job | After NOC or similar | NOC or security role |
| **Deliverables** | Uptime, tickets, runbooks | Designs, standards, diagrams | Policies, rules, secure design |

Start with NOC or a junior role if you want to learn the network from the inside; move to design or security as you grow. The [Beginner roadmap](#/learning/networking/beginner-networking-roadmap) applies to all three paths.
