# Certifications & Career in DevOps

How certs fit the [roadmaps](#/learning/devops/beginner-devops-roadmap), what roles to expect, and how to get the first job. Kept concise so it stays maintainable; adjust for your region and market.

## Entry and associate level

- **CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)** — Hands-on K8s admin cert; performance-based exam. Good after you complete the [Intermediate roadmap](#/learning/devops/intermediate-devops-roadmap) K8s section. Widely recognized for DevOps and SRE roles.
- **CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer)** — K8s from the app developer angle; also hands-on. Good if you work closely with devs or do both dev and deploy. Slightly easier than CKA for many.
- **Terraform Associate (HashiCorp)** — IaC with Terraform; multiple choice. Good after you have real Terraform usage from the [Intermediate](#/learning/devops/intermediate-devops-roadmap) IaC section.
- **Cloud associate (AWS Solutions Architect, Azure Administrator, GCP Associate Cloud Engineer)** — Vendor cloud fundamentals. Pick one provider; useful when you add cloud in [Intermediate](#/learning/devops/intermediate-devops-roadmap) and [Advanced](#/learning/devops/advanced-devops-roadmap).

## Professional and specialist

- **CKS (Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist)** — K8s security; do after CKA when you want to signal security depth. Aligns with [Advanced](#/learning/devops/advanced-devops-roadmap) security and scale.
- **Cloud professional (AWS DevOps Pro, Azure DevOps Engineer, etc.)** — Deeper cloud and pipeline design. Do when you are operating in that cloud daily.
- **Other** — LF (Linux Foundation), Red Hat (OpenShift), and vendor-specific certs. Choose based on job postings and your target role; see [Roles](#/learning/devops/devops-roles-and-expectations).

## Typical roles and progression

- **Junior DevOps / DevOps engineer** — Build and maintain pipelines, support developers, run containers and some infra. Often the first role after labs and one or two certs. Expect 1–3 years before moving to mid-level. See [Where to Practice](#/learning/devops/where-to-practice-devops) to build the portfolio that interviews expect.
- **Senior DevOps / SRE** — Own reliability (SLOs, incidents, postmortems), design pipelines and platform, mentor. See [Intermediate](#/learning/devops/intermediate-devops-roadmap) and [Advanced](#/learning/devops/advanced-devops-roadmap).
- **Platform engineer / Lead / Principal** — Own the internal platform or technical direction; cross-team alignment and strategy. See [Roles](#/learning/devops/devops-roles-and-expectations) and [Advanced roadmap](#/learning/devops/advanced-devops-roadmap).

Titles vary by employer; focus on the work (pipelines, reliability, platform) rather than the label.

## Getting the first job

- **Lab and document** — Every lab should produce a clear repo: Dockerfile, pipeline, Terraform (if applicable), and a short README. GitHub profile with real projects gets your name in front of hiring managers. The [FAQ](#/learning/devops/devops-faq) and roadmaps answer “how long” and “what to learn”; this page answers “what’s next” after learning.
- **Apply widely** — Junior DevOps and “DevOps engineer” roles are competitive. Apply to product companies, startups, and enterprises. Read the description for pipeline, containers, and cloud.
- **Interview prep** — Be ready to explain: how a change goes from commit to production, how you’d debug a failing pipeline or a down service, and one project you built. Technical questions often focus on Linux, Git, CI, Docker, and basic K8s; see [Glossary](#/learning/devops/devops-glossary) and the roadmaps for concepts to reinforce.

## Summary

- First role is often junior DevOps or DevOps engineer; progress to senior, SRE, or platform as you grow. Documentation and communication matter as much as technical skills.
- Build a lab habit, get one or two relevant certs (e.g. CKA or Terraform Associate), document your work in Git, and apply. The [FAQ](#/learning/devops/devops-faq) and roadmaps answer “how long” and “what to learn”; this page answers “what’s next” after learning.
