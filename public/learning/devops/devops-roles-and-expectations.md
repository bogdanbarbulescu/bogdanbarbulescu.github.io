# DevOps, SRE & Platform: Roles and Expectations

A clear comparison so you know what each path involves and which fits you. For the learning path itself, see the [roadmaps](#/learning/devops/beginner-devops-roadmap).

---

## DevOps Engineer

- **What they do** — Own or improve the path from code to production: CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, environment consistency, and collaboration between dev and ops. Often also handle monitoring, incident response, and some infrastructure (cloud or on-prem).
- **Day-to-day** — Pipeline design and fixes, scripting and IaC, supporting developers, improving deploy speed and safety. Mix of building tooling and running systems.
- **Who it fits** — People who like both coding and operations and want to remove friction in the release process. Often the first “DevOps” role; see [Certifications & Career](#/learning/devops/devops-certifications-and-career).

---

## SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)

- **What they do** — Apply software engineering to operations: automation, SLIs/SLOs, error budgets, and reducing toil. Focus on reliability and scalability; often own on-call and post-incident reviews.
- **Day-to-day** — Writing automation (runbooks, tooling), defining and measuring SLOs, capacity planning, and incident response. Closer to “engineer who keeps systems up” than “ops who scripts.”
- **Who it fits** — People who like systems and code and want to make services reliable at scale. See [Intermediate](#/learning/devops/intermediate-devops-roadmap) and [Advanced](#/learning/devops/advanced-devops-roadmap) for SRE-relevant topics.

---

## Platform Engineer

- **What they do** — Build and run the internal platform that other developers use: APIs, CI/CD, container orchestration (e.g. K8s), internal tooling, and standards. “Product” is the platform; “users” are devs.
- **Day-to-day** — Designing and maintaining platform services, onboarding teams, improving developer experience, and keeping the platform secure and observable.
- **Who it fits** — People who want to own the foundation others build on. Usually after some years in DevOps or SRE; see [Advanced roadmap](#/learning/devops/advanced-devops-roadmap).

---

## Build / Release Engineer

- **What they do** — Focused on build systems, artifact management, and release process: making sure builds are reproducible, fast, and that releases are consistent and auditable.
- **Day-to-day** — Build pipelines, dependency management, release tooling, and coordination with dev and QA. Narrower scope than “full” DevOps but deep in that slice.
- **Who it fits** — People who enjoy build systems and release mechanics. Can be an entry path or a specialization; see [Toolchain overview](#/learning/devops/devops-toolchain-overview).

## Quick comparison

| | DevOps | SRE | Platform |
|--|--------|-----|----------|
| **Focus** | Code-to-prod, culture, tooling | Reliability, automation, SLOs | Internal platform for devs |
| **Typical entry** | Junior DevOps, ex-sysadmin/dev | After DevOps or SWE | After DevOps/SRE |
| **Deliverables** | Pipelines, automation, docs | SLOs, runbooks, reliability | Platform APIs, standards |

Titles vary by employer; focus on the work (pipelines, reliability, platform) rather than the label. The [Beginner roadmap](#/learning/devops/beginner-devops-roadmap) applies to all of these paths.
