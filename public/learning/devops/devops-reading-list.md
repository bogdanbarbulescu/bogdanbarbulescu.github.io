# Further Reading & Resources

A curated list of books, docs, and courses. The [roadmaps](#/learning/devops/beginner-devops-roadmap) are the hub; these are for deep dives and staying current. Links are external; we do not maintain an exhaustive list—prioritize quality and relevance to your stage.

## Books

- **DevOps culture and practice** — *The Phoenix Project* (Kim et al.) for the story of DevOps adoption; *The DevOps Handbook* for practices and patterns. Good early in the [Beginner](#/learning/devops/beginner-devops-roadmap) journey.
- **SRE** — *Site Reliability Engineering* (Google; free online) and *The Site Reliability Workbook* for SLIs, SLOs, error budgets, and incident response. Fits [Intermediate](#/learning/devops/intermediate-devops-roadmap) and [Advanced](#/learning/devops/advanced-devops-roadmap).
- **Containers and Kubernetes** — *Kubernetes in Action* or *Managing Kubernetes* (O’Reilly) for depth. Official Kubernetes docs are the reference; see [Where to Practice](#/learning/devops/where-to-practice-devops) for labs.
- **IaC** — *Terraform: Up & Running* (O’Reilly) for Terraform; vendor docs for CloudFormation/Bicep. Pair with [Intermediate](#/learning/devops/intermediate-devops-roadmap) IaC section.

## Official docs and references

- **Kubernetes** — [kubernetes.io/docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/) — Concepts, tutorials, and API reference. Use when learning K8s and for [cert prep](#/learning/devops/devops-certifications-and-career).
- **Terraform** — [terraform.io/docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs) — Provider docs and best practices. Use when writing IaC.
- **Docker** — [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/) — Dockerfile, Compose, and engine. Use with [Beginner](#/learning/devops/beginner-devops-roadmap) and [Where to Practice](#/learning/devops/where-to-practice-devops).
- **Cloud providers** — AWS, GCP, and Azure learning paths and architecture docs. Use when you add cloud in [Intermediate](#/learning/devops/intermediate-devops-roadmap) and [Advanced](#/learning/devops/advanced-devops-roadmap).

## Online and video

- **CNCF** — Cloud Native Computing Foundation: [cncf.io](https://www.cncf.io/) — Projects (K8s, Prometheus, etc.) and free courses (e.g. Kubernetes learning path).
- **Vendor learning** — GitHub Learning Lab, GitLab docs, HashiCorp Learn (Terraform). Align with the toolchain you use; see [Toolchain overview](#/learning/devops/devops-toolchain-overview).
- **Courses** — Many solid “DevOps bootcamp” and “Kubernetes for developers” series. Prefer those that include hands-on (pipelines, Docker, K8s); avoid passive-only.

---

## Conferences and community

- **KubeCon / CloudNativeCon** — CNCF events; keynotes and breakouts on K8s, observability, and platform. Recordings often available.
- **DevOps and SRE meetups** — Local and virtual; good for real-world stories and hiring trends. See [Certifications & Career](#/learning/devops/devops-certifications-and-career) for role context.
- **Reddit and forums** — r/devops, r/kubernetes, r/terraform for Q&A and discussions.

**Prefer doing over consuming** — Reading supports practice; it does not replace it. Use [Where to Practice](#/learning/devops/where-to-practice-devops) and the roadmaps to stay hands-on, and [Certifications & Career](#/learning/devops/devops-certifications-and-career) to align reading with your job goals.
