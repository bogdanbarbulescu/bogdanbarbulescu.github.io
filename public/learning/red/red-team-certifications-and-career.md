# Certifications & Career in Red Team

How certs fit the [roadmaps](#/learning/red/beginner-red-team-roadmap), what roles to expect, and how to get the first job. Kept concise so it stays maintainable; adjust for your region and market.

## Certifications: How They Fit the Roadmaps

### Beginner Stage (0–12 months)

- **eJPT / eJPTv2** (eLearnSecurity) — Entry-level practical cert. Good after you have basic host/network/web skills from the [Beginner roadmap](#/learning/red/beginner-red-team-roadmap). Reinforces methodology; not required but useful as a first credential.
- **PNPT** (TCM Security) — Practical Network Penetration Tester. Strong on AD, OSINT, and reporting; realistic exam. Aim after you can compromise your own AD lab end-to-end (late beginner or early intermediate).
- **Avoid for now** — OSCP and CRTO before you have solid foundations. Certs that are purely multiple-choice with no hands-on add less value at this stage.

### Intermediate Stage (6–18 months)

- **OSCP** (Offensive Security) — The common HR filter. Hands-on exam (machines + report) and a small buffer overflow component. Prepare with timeboxing, report practice, and HTB/Proving Grounds. Sit when you consistently root medium boxes and can write a clean report under time pressure. See [Intermediate roadmap](#/learning/red/intermediate-red-team-roadmap).
- **CRTO** (Zero-Point Security) — Certified Red Team Operator. C2- and AD-focused; practical lab and exam. Good when you are moving toward red team (not just pentest) and understand OPSEC. Do not do it before you are solid on AD and detection basics.
- **Other practical certs** — PNPT (if not done earlier), vendor-specific (e.g. Azure AD, cloud) if your role needs them. Prefer certs that require a hands-on exam and a report.

### Advanced Stage (12+ months)

- **OSEP, OSED, etc.** (Offensive Security) — Specialized (evasion, exploit dev). Only if your path is exploit development or advanced tradecraft; not required for most red team leads.
- **Multiple certs** — Depth matters more than count. One OSCP or CRTO done well is better than three certs done poorly. Use certs to prove you can perform; use engagements and reports to prove you can deliver.

## Typical Roles

- **Junior penetration tester / red team analyst** — Supporting seniors: recon, running agreed tools, documenting evidence, and contributing to reports. Often the first role after certs and labs. Expect 1–3 years before moving to mid-level.
- **Penetration tester / red team operator** — Running engagements (or significant parts of them), writing findings, and presenting to clients. May specialize (web, internal, AD, red team).
- **Senior / lead** — Scoping engagements, coordinating the team, owning client communication and report quality. See [Advanced roadmap](#/learning/red/advanced-red-team-roadmap).
- **Principal / research** — Deep technical or methodological leadership; may publish research, develop tooling, or set standards. Optional path; not required for a strong career.

Titles vary by employer; focus on the work (pentest vs red team, internal vs external, scope and deliverables) rather than the label.

## What to Expect

- **Workload** — Mix of technical work (testing, tooling, research) and non-technical (reports, calls, scoping, documentation). The “hacking all day” image is wrong; reporting and communication are a large part of the job.
- **Salary and conditions** — Vary by region, employer, and experience. Junior roles exist; salaries tend to rise with experience and certs. Research your market (job boards, salary surveys) rather than relying on generic figures.
- **Remote vs on-site** — Many roles allow remote or hybrid; some engagements require on-site (e.g. physical testing, client preference). Check job postings and ask in interviews.

## Getting the First Job

- **Portfolio** — Labs, writeups, and (if possible) sample reports (sanitized). Show that you can document and communicate, not just run tools. GitHub, a blog, or a simple portfolio site help.
- **One solid practical cert** — OSCP, CRTO, PNPT, or equivalent. It signals that you can pass a hands-on exam and write a report. Pair it with the portfolio.
- **Networking** — Conferences (BSides, DEF CON, local meetups), Twitter/LinkedIn (follow practitioners, engage thoughtfully), and contributing (writeups, open source) get your name in front of hiring managers.
- **Apply widely** — Pentest and red team roles are competitive. Apply to consultancies, MSSPs, and internal teams. Junior roles may be listed as “associate” or “analyst”; read the description for hands-on testing and reporting.
- **Interview prep** — Be ready to explain your methodology, a lab or engagement you did, and how you wrote it up. Technical questions often focus on AD, networking, and web; soft questions on scope, RoE, and handling findings. See [Ethics & RoE](#/learning/red/ethics-and-rules-of-engagement) and the roadmaps.

## Summary

- Use certs to prove you can perform; use the roadmaps to build the skills that certs test. Do not stack certs without depth.
- First role is often junior pentester or red team analyst; progress to operator, then lead or principal if you want. Reporting and client skills matter as much as technical skills.
- Build a portfolio, get one solid practical cert, network, and apply. The [FAQ](#/learning/red/red-team-faq) and roadmaps answer “how long” and “what to learn”; this page answers “what’s next” after learning.
