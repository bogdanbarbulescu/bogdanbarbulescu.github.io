# Red Team, Pentest & Blue Team: Roles and Expectations

A clear comparison so you know what each path involves and which fits you. For the learning path itself, see the [roadmaps](#/learning/red/beginner-red-team-roadmap).

## Red Team

- **What they do** — Simulate real adversaries to test whether the organization can detect and respond. Goal: achieve a specific objective (e.g. access to crown jewels, domain admin, exfil of sample data) and demonstrate impact. Often multi-week, with C2, persistence, and evasion.
- **Typical scope** — Broader than a classic pentest: may include phishing, social engineering, physical (if agreed), and “assume breach” internal work. Rules of engagement define what is allowed.
- **Deliverable** — Report that tells the story: timeline, attack path, what was achieved, what was (or should have been) detected, and how to fix it. Findings are tied to the objective and business impact.
- **Day-to-day** — Recon, initial access (if in scope), execution, persistence, lateral movement, documentation. Lots of reading logs and tuning tradecraft. Report writing and client communication. Not “hacking 24/7”; a lot is planning, coordination, and writing.
- **Who it fits** — People who like sustained operations, thinking like an adversary, and connecting technical actions to business risk. You need to be comfortable with ambiguity (real networks are messy) and with writing for both technical and management readers.

## Penetration Test (Pentest)

- **What they do** — Authorized testing to find vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in defined scope (e.g. web apps, internal network, external perimeter). Goal: identify and report findings so the client can remediate.
- **Typical scope** — Often fixed: these systems, these apps, no phishing (or phishing as a separate engagement). Shorter duration (days to a few weeks). Scope creep into “red team style” should be agreed explicitly.
- **Deliverable** — Findings report: each vuln with description, evidence, severity, and remediation. May include exec summary and ATT&CK mapping. Less emphasis on a single “attack story” unless it was a scenario-based test.
- **Day-to-day** — Recon, scanning, manual testing, exploitation, evidence collection, report writing. More vuln-centric; less long-term C2 and evasion. Still a lot of documentation and client communication.
- **Who it fits** — People who like structured scope, clear deliverables, and variety (different clients and systems). Good entry point; many red teamers start in pentest and move to red team as scope and objectives expand.

## Blue Team

- **What they do** — Defend: monitor, detect, respond. SOC analysts triage alerts; detection engineers build and tune rules; incident responders contain and remediate. They react to what red team (or real attackers) do.
- **Typical scope** — Internal: logs, EDR, SIEM, threat intel. They do not “attack”; they improve visibility and response.
- **Deliverable** — Detection rules, playbooks, incident reports, and improvements to logging and tooling. Success = catching attacks (including red team) and reducing time to detect and respond.
- **Day-to-day** — Alert triage, log analysis, tuning Sigma/alerting, incident response, and collaboration with red team in purple exercises.
- **Who it fits** — People who like puzzles (finding the needle in the haystack), building systems (detection, automation), and being the “defender.” Understanding blue team makes you a better red teamer (OPSEC, detection awareness).

## Side-by-Side

| | Red Team | Pentest | Blue Team |
|--|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Primary goal** | Achieve objective; show impact | Find and report vulns | Detect and respond |
| **Scope** | Often broad (phishing, internal, C2) | Usually defined systems/apps | Internal monitoring and response |
| **Duration** | Often weeks | Days to few weeks | Ongoing |
| **Deliverable** | Story + findings + impact | Findings + remediation | Rules, playbooks, incidents |
| **Mindset** | Adversary; “can we get there?” | Tester; “what’s broken?” | Defender; “what do we see?” |

## How to Choose

- **Start with pentest** if you want clear scope, lots of vuln hunting, and a standard path (OSCP, etc.) into the industry. Many red team roles assume or prefer pentest experience.
- **Start with red team** if you are drawn to adversary emulation and full-scope operations. You will still need solid fundamentals (same as pentest); the [Beginner roadmap](#/learning/red/beginner-red-team-roadmap) applies to both.
- **Start with blue team** if you prefer defense and want to understand detection first. You can move to red later; purple team roles sit in the middle.
- **You can move between them.** Pentest → red team is common. Red teamers who understand blue (OPSEC, detection) are more valuable. Use the [Glossary](#/learning/red/red-team-glossary) and roadmaps to build the skills that transfer across all three.
