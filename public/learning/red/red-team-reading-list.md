# Further Reading & Resources

A curated list of books, blogs, vendor reports, conferences, and courses. The app and [roadmaps](#/learning/red/beginner-red-team-roadmap) are the hub; these are for deep dives and staying current. Links are external; we do not maintain an exhaustive list—prioritize quality and relevance to your stage.

## Books

- **Operating system and networking** — Any solid OS and TCP/IP book (e.g. Tanenbaum for OS, Forouzan or Kurose for networking) for foundations. Red team-specific: *Windows Internals* (Russinovich et al.) for deep Windows; *Network Security Assessment* (McNab) for practical recon and vuln assessment.
- **Red team and pentest** — *Red Team Development and Operations* (Joe Vest, James Tubberville) for red team process and tradecraft. *The Hacker Playbook 3* (Peter Kim) for practical pentest scenarios. *Penetration Testing* (Georgia Weidman) for a structured intro.
- **Active Directory** — *Active Directory* (Albers et al.) or similar for AD fundamentals. Many AD attack resources are online (blogs, BH/CRTO content); pair with the [Intermediate roadmap](#/learning/red/intermediate-red-team-roadmap).
- **Reporting and soft skills** — *The Pentester BluePrint* (Phillip Wylie) includes career and mindset. General technical writing and communication books help for reports and client communication.

## Blogs and Sites

- **Vendor threat intel and research** — Mandiant (Google), CrowdStrike, Microsoft (MSRC, threat intel), SentinelOne, etc. Publish adversary reports and TTPs; use them to inform technique choice and reporting, not to chase every new report.
- **Detection and blue perspective** — Sigma Project (sigma rules), detection blogs (e.g. detection engineering posts from SOC/DFIR folks). Understanding what defenders deploy improves your OPSEC and report quality.
- **Offensive and red team** — SpecterOps (BloodHound, AD research), Outflank, MDSec, etc. Many practitioners publish technique writeups and tool releases. Follow a few that match your focus (AD, C2, evasion).
- **General infosec** — Krebs on Security, Dark Reading, The Hacker News for news. Use sparingly; depth comes from the roadmaps and hands-on practice.

## Conferences and Talks

- **Black Hat, DEF CON, BSides** — Major conferences; talks are often recorded (Black Hat USA, DEF CON YouTube). Pick talks on AD, red team operations, detection, and reporting.
- **Vendor conferences** — Offensive Security (OffSec), SANS, etc. Often paid; useful if your employer sponsors or you are investing in a cert track.
- **Local BSides** — Community-driven; good for networking and shorter talks. Search “BSides [city].”

## Courses and Training

- **Structured learning** — Align with the roadmaps: TryHackMe and HackTheBox paths for beginners; OffSec (OSCP path), Zero-Point Security (CRTO), TCM Security (PNPT), and similar for intermediate/advanced. Prefer courses that include hands-on and reporting, not just video.
- **Vendor training** — SANS (expensive but respected), OffSec (OSCP, OSED, etc.), and niche vendors for AD, C2, or cloud. Choose based on your stage and budget; see [Certifications & Career](#/learning/red/red-team-certifications-and-career).
- **Free and low-cost** — OverTheWire, PicoCTF, THM free rooms, and YouTube walkthroughs (use after you have tried yourself). Do not substitute passive watching for hands-on practice.

## How to Use This List

- **Do not try to read everything** — Pick one or two books and one or two blogs/sources that match your current phase. Rotate as you advance.
- **Prefer doing over consuming** — Reading supports practice; it does not replace it. Use the [Where to Practice](#/learning/red/where-to-practice-red-team) resource and the roadmaps to stay hands-on.
- **Contribute back** — When you write a writeup, improve a tool, or publish detection, you become part of the reading list for others. The community stays strong when people share.

If you find a resource that fits this section and is high quality, consider contributing it to the project (e.g. via a pull request to this file)—the app is open source and the list can grow with the community.
