Case Studies
Case studies or presentations are the best way of demonstrating the full scope of your projects. Each project should have its own story that shows the progress of the whole process, from beginning to the final outcome. Break down this creative process with lots of photos and notes revealing whatâ€™s behind each project.
This way your visitors can get a sense of what your projects are like, and how you moved from the initial planning phase to completion. Here are the components to include in your case study:
Purpose of the project: Why did you start the project.
Objective: What you accomplished.
Approach: How you accomplished it.
Project duration: How long it took you.
Your role: How you contributed to the team or project.
Final product overview: Pictures, videos, links, etc.
